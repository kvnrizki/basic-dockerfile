# basic-dockerfile
Build a basic Dockerfile to create a Docker image.

Project detail: https://roadmap.sh/projects/basic-dockerfile

In this project, you will write a basic Dockerfile to create a Docker image. When this Docker image is run, it should print "Hello, Captain!" to the console before exiting.

## Requirements

* The Dockerfile should be named **`Dockerfile`**.
* The Dockerfile should be in the root directory of the project.
* The base image should be **`alpine:latest`**.
* The Dockerfile should contain a single instruction to print "Hello, Captain!" to the console before exiting.

You can learn more about writing a Dockerfile [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

If you are looking to build a more advanced version of this project, you can consider adding the ability to pass your name to the Docker image as an argument, and have the Docker image print "Hello, [your name]!" instead of "Hello, Captain!".

## How To Run
1. Build image
```
docker build -t basic-dockerfile .
```
2. Run image
```
docker run basic-dockerfile [optional-name]
```
